                                        Physiotherapy, also known as physical therapy, is a healthcare profession
                                        focused on assessing, diagnosing, and treating musculoskeletal and neurological
                                        conditions. It involves a range of techniques such as manual therapy, exercise
                                        prescription, and modalities like ultrasound and electrical stimulation to
                                        promote recovery and improve function.

                                        work within your tolerance level and communicate with you to ensure that you are
                                        comfortable throughout the session.
